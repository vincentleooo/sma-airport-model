        <h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
        <p>
          An internet connection is required to access outside libraries. A
          modern browser updated within this year (2021) is preferred due to
          some newer CSS dependencies.
        </p>

        <h2 id="usermanual">User manual</h2>

        <h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>

        <p>
          The objective of this simulation is to bring a passenger from the the
          plane (left border) and out of the system. There are two ways of
          exiting: one is through the normal way of clearing the defined
          stations, the other is when, if there is a testing station, the
          passenger tested positive for COVID-19. The behaviour of the
          passengers is that they will all walk at the same speed without social
          distancing, always moving forward, and selection of queues will be
          done either randomly or in choosing the shortest queue (user-set
          probability). Moreover, for COVID-19 testings, everything is assumed
          to be 100% accurate.
        </p>

        <h4>Immigration station</h4>

        <p>
          The immigration station is comprised of pair-wise queue lanes and
          booths. The behaviour is a simple one in that passengers will queue
          and wait for their turn to go next into the booth.
        </p>

        <h4>Testing station</h4>

        <p>
          The testing station is similar to the immigration station. But, after
          the booth, the passengers go into a waiting area where they randomly
          choose their sitting positions to wait for a set amount of time.
        </p>

        <h4>Baggage area</h4>

        <p>
          The baggage area is simple. It contains a lane to enter in (which is
          not a queue) and a baggage area afterwards. This is, of course,
          assuming that the baggages are not on carousels as per normal, but
          left down on the ground due to the special circumstances. The
          passenger will try to look for their baggages within this area and
          then leave.
        </p>

        <h3 id="uielements">UI elements</h3>
        <p>
          The lines before the simulation box denote the changing variables
          during the simulation. This includes the time within the current
          simulation, the number of exited passengers within the current
          simulation, and the average time taken per passenger within the
          current simulation along with the average time taken to finish one
          simulation and its standard deviation over the set amount of
          simulations.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          The model box will draw according to the inputs set under the heading
          <b>Stations</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Below the simulation box, there are two graphs: one to track the
          average time taken per passenger within one simulation run, and the
          other one to track the average time taken to finish one simulation
          run.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Graphs below the simulation box</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Right below that, there are control buttons to start, pause, and reset
          the simulations. It is also possible to download the data collected
          for the time taken per simulation over one or multiple simulations as
          a CSV file.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Buttons controlling simulation</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3 id="inputs">Inputs</h3>

        There are three different sections covering different aspects of the
        simulation. One is <b>Stations</b>, which covers both the layout of the
        stations within the simulation box and the global simulation settings.
        The next one is <b>Station Parameters</b>, which is used to customise
        how many booths or lanes each station has. The final one is
        <b>Agent Parameters</b>, which control the agents' behaviours and time
        taken to go through each station.

        <figure>
          <img src="./img/inputs.png" alt="Inputs" class="responsive" />
          <figcaption>Inputs</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h4>Stations</h4>

        <p>
          There must be at least one choice of station for the simulation to
          run. The station numbers correspond to their position on the
          simulation box from left to right. For example, the picture below
          shows when Station 1 is Immigration, Station 2 is Testing, and Station
          3 is Baggage.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="./img/example1.png"
            alt="Example position"
            class="responsive"
          />
          <figcaption>Example position</figcaption>
        </figure>

        The wide rectangle on the left of each station is the queue or lane. The
        booths are represented by the solid squares. The tall rectangles on the
        right of the Testing and Baggage stations are for waiting areas and
        baggage collection areas respectively.

        <h4>Station Parameters</h4>

        The dropdowns denote the amount (from one to ten) of booths, queues, or
        lanes provided in the simulation for each station. An example for when
        the immigration booth is set to have five booths is as follows.

        <figure>
          <img
            src="./img/example2.png"
            alt="Example of multiple queues"
            class="responsive1"
          />
          <figcaption>Example of multiple booths and queues</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h4>Agent Parameters</h4>
        The rates that are denoted in seconds will be converted into their
        per-second probability (its inverse), excepting the COVID test time,
        which is a definite time delay. This meant that the probability, for
        example, of an arrival rate of 30 seconds will be 1/30 per second.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Arrival rate: the mean time taken for each passenger to enter the
            simulation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Immigration rate: the mean time to clear immigration for each
            passenger
          </li>
          <li>Testing rate: the mean time to clear the testing booth.</li>
          <li>
            COVID probability: the probability of each passenger having COVID.
          </li>
          <li>
            Baggage collection probability: the probability that when a
            passenger reaches the baggage area, their baggage is found.
          </li>
          <li>COVID test time: the time taken to clear the COVID test.</li>
          <li>
            Randomly chosen queue: the probability that a passenger will deviate
            from the rational queue choice (shortest queue).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="technical">Behaviours and code</h2>

        <p>
          This is going to be a high level description of the model, written in
          the perception of an individual agent. The animations are done using
          the <a href="https://d3js.org">D3.js</a> library.
        </p>

        <iframe
          src="https://www.thiscodeworks.com/embed/61b4af84fe9bbd0015d5e7f1"
          style="
            width: 100%;
            height: 333px;
            border-radius: 12px;
            overflow: clip;
          "
          frameborder="0"
          scrolling="no"
        ></iframe>

        <p>
          This shows the code for each second passing. Firstly, it is the
          garbage collection. This means that it will try to clear out whichever
          agent is at the going out state. Afterwards, it will create new
          passengers based on the rates set by the user as long as the number of
          passengers does not exceed the specified amount of passengers. It will
          then update the positions of all the agents in the simulation based on
          their target locations.
        </p>

        <h3 id="removingpassengers">Removing passengers</h3>

        <p>
          In removing the passengers, it deletes both the passengers data and
          the data associated with the animation.
        </p>
        <iframe
          src="https://www.thiscodeworks.com/embed/61b4b05cfe9bbd0015d5e7f2"

        ></iframe>

        <h3 id="addingpassengers">Adding passengers</h3>

        <p>
          In this case, it will follow a process of finding the next station. It
          will either choose the queue lane for the next station rationally
          based on queue lengths or based on random choice. This parameter is
          set by the user. Afterwards, other attributes are assigned to keep
          track of its state. The user's choice for COVID infected probability
          will affect how many passengers have COVID.
        </p>
        <iframe
          src="https://www.thiscodeworks.com/embed/61b4b094fe9bbd0015d5e7f3"
          style="
            width: 100%;
            height: 500px;
            border-radius: 12px;
            overflow: clip;
          "
          frameborder="0"
          scrolling="no"
        ></iframe>

        <h3 id="updatingpassengers">Updating passengers</h3>

        <p>
          In updating the passenger, there will be roughly two different states.
          One is when the passenger is still on the way to a target, and one
          where the passenger has reached a target. Depending on the station,
          the passenger will do different things.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the immigration booth, the passenger will queue up until it is
          their turn. After coming out of the booth, it will select the next
          station. At the testing booth, the passenger will also queue up to get
          tested. Afterwards, it is a free seating environment within the area
          used to wait for test results. At the baggage collection area, the
          passenger will go through the lanes into a space where the baggages
          are placed. They will then try to find their baggages. This
          probability is set by the user. If the next station is to go out, they
          will then proceed to go to the exit node.
        </p>

        <p>
          For COVID patients who are screened during testing, they will go out
          via a different path, thus reducing their time taken to go through the
          simulation.
        </p>

        <h4 id="jshacks">
          JavaScript objects and using different ways to get keys or values
        </h4>

        <p>
          The example below shows the different ways to get keys or values
          within an object. This is how the model was able to find the positions
          of the stations based on what is set by the user and to connect the
          pieces together such that the passenger can find the next station and
          hence the queue. The object keys associated with queues are always
          called <tt>{station} + Queue</tt>. This leads to the stations behaving
          like Lego blocks, being able to connect with any other station with a
          standard input/output.
        </p>
        <iframe
          src="https://www.thiscodeworks.com/embed/61b5cbaa2ecc3700152aa61a"
          style="
            width: 100%;
            height: 476px;

          "
          frameborder="0"
          scrolling="no"
        ></iframe>

        <h4>Area creation</h4>

        <p>
          The creation of the areas will depend on whether the positions of the
          stations are defined (>0 in this case). Depending on the number of
          queues or booths set, the <tt>objects</tt> object will be modified
          where the stations' booths or queues will be added in such that it can
          be generated later on. Below is an example for the immigration booth.
        </p>
        <iframe

          scrolling="no"
        ></iframe>

        <h4>Tracking states and substates</h4>
        <p>
          The passengers have a <tt>state</tt> to denote which station to go,
          and a <tt>queueState</tt> to denote which part of each station to go
          to. They also have the <tt>station</tt> integer key to denote which
          part of the simulation box they are in, and as such they can track
          their progress and go find which station is in the next part using the
          tricks mentioned <a href="#jshacks">above</a>.
