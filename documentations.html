        <h2>User manual</h2>
        <h3>UI elements</h3>
        <p>The lines before the simulation box denote the changing variables during the simulation. This includes the time within the current simulation, the number of exited passengers within the current simulation, and the average time taken per passenger within the current simulation along with the average time taken to finish one simulation and its standard deviation over the set amount of simulations.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>The model box will draw according to the inputs set under the heading <b>Stations</b>.</p>

        <p>Below the simulation box, there are two graphs: one to track the average time taken per passenger within one simulation run, and the other one to track the average time taken to finish one simulation run.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>Right below that, there are control buttons to start, pause, and reset the simulations. It is also possible to download the data collected for the time taken per simulation over one or multiple simulations as a CSV file.</p>

        <h3>Inputs</h3>

        There are three different sections covering different aspects of the simulation. One is <b>Stations</b>, which covers both the layout of the stations within the simulation box and the global simulation settings. The next one is <b>Station Parameters</b>, which is used to customise how many booths or lanes each station has. The final one is <b>Agent Parameters</b>, which control the agents' behaviours and time taken to go through each station.

        <figure>
          <img src="./img/inputs.png" alt="Inputs" class="responsive">
          <figcaption>Inputs</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h4>Stations</h4>

        <p>There must be at least one choice of station for the simulation to run. The station numbers correspond to their position on the simulation box from left to right. For example, the picture below shows when Station 1 is Immigration, Station 2 is Testing, and Station 3 is Baggage.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="./img/example1.png" alt="Example position" class="responsive">
          <figcaption>Example position</figcaption>
        </figure>

        The wide rectangle on the left of each station is the queue or lane. The booths are represented by the solid squares. The tall rectangles on the right of the Testing and Baggage stations are for waiting areas and baggage collection areas respectively.

        <h4>Station Parameters</h4>

        The dropdowns denote the amount (from one to ten) of booths, queues, or lanes provided in the simulation for each station. An example for when the immigration booth is set to have five booths is as follows.

        <figure>
          <img src="./img/example2.png" alt="Example of multiple queues" class="responsive1">
          <figcaption>Example of multiple booths and queues</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h4>Agent Parameters</h4>
        The rates that are denoted in seconds will be converted into their per-second probability (its inverse), excepting the COVID test time, which is a definite time delay. This meant that the probability, for example, of an arrival rate of 30 seconds will be 1/30 per second.

        <ul><li>Arrival rate: the mean time taken for each passenger to enter the simulation.</li>
        <li>Immigration rate: the mean time to clear immigration for each passenger</li>
        <li>Testing rate: the mean time to clear the testing booth.</li>
        <li>COVID probability: the probability of each passenger having COVID.</li>
        <li>Baggage collection probability: the probability that when a passenger reaches the baggage area, their baggage is found.</li>
        <li>COVID test time: the time taken to clear the COVID test.</li>
        <li>Randomly chosen queue: the probability that a passenger will deviate from the rational queue choice (shortest queue).</li></ul>

        <h2>Behaviours and code</h2>

        <p>This is going to be a high level description of the model, written in the perception of an individual agent.</p>
        
        <iframe src="https://www.thiscodeworks.com/embed/61b4af84fe9bbd0015d5e7f1" style="width: 100%; height: 333px;" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          
        <p>This shows the code for each second passing. Firstly, it is the garbage collection. This means that it will try to clear out whichever agent is at the going out state. Afterwards, it will create new passengers based on the rates set by the user as long as the number of passengers does not exceed the specified amount of passengers. It will then update the positions of all the agents in the simulation based on their target locations.</p>

        <h3>Removing passengers</h3>

        
        <p>In removing the passengers, it deletes both the passengers data and the data associated with the animation.</p>

        <h3>Adding passengers</h3>
        
        <p>In this case, it will follow a process of finding the next station. It will either choose the queue lane for the next station rationally based on queue lengths or based on random choice. This parameter is set by the user. Afterwards, other attributes are assigned to keep track of its state. The user's choice for COVID infected probability will affect how many passengers have COVID.</p>

        <h3>Updating passengers</h3>

        
        <p>In updating the passenger, there will be roughly two different states. One is when the passenger is still on the way to a target, and one where the passenger has reached a target. Depending on the station, the passenger will do different things.</p>
        
        <p>At the immigration booth, the passenger will queue up until it is their turn. After coming out of the booth, it will select the next station. At the testing booth, the passenger will also queue up to get tested. Afterwards, it is a free seating environment within the area used to wait for test results. At the baggage collection area, the passenger will go through the lanes into a space where the baggages are placed. They will then try to find their baggages. This probability is set by the user. If the next station is to go out, they will then proceed to go to the exit node.</p>
        
        <p>For COVID patients who are screened during testing, they will go out via a different path, thus reducing their time taken to go through the simulation.</p>
